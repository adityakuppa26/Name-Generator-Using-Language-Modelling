# Name-Generator-Using-Language-Modelling

Uses a character-level language model, to learn from a million examples and thereafter generate new names on its own.  
A few of them after a few iterations are:  
ethreen  
blenn  
ginnie  
lyvina  
hilford  
roza  
gerraro  
  
The model uses an RNN with a basic RNN unit, implemented from scratch using python. The test dataset has been taken from a kaggle competition.
